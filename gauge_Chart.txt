Gauge charts display data in a graph style that is similar to speedometers in automobiles. They also work well with multiple datasets but not one with a single dataset. In the following code, we have an example of a gauge chart, which is a very simple pygal chart. This time, we will use some new data; in this case, we will use a dataset that represents the space shuttle speed from the time of launch to 20 minutes.

Let's look at our sample code and our chart in the following code snippet. Copy the code into your editor of choice, and ensure that you save the file to gauge_chart.svg:
